## What We Know So Far

### January - February, China

When the Covid-19 pandemic began in Wuhan, China, doctors and researchers there started to desperately search for drugs that can be used to treat the disease until a vaccine could be developed.  

It appears CQ/HCQ was first used for Covid-19 in China.  In December 2019 and January 2020, the doctors in Hubei Wuhan University Peoples' Hospital noticed none of their lupus (Chinese:红斑狼疮) patients contracted Covid-19.  Because these patients were long-term HCQ users, they suspected HCQ can be used to treat or prevent Covid-19.  On February 4th, they started clinical trial, only a few days later they found HCQ was effective.  [source (in Chinese)](https://www.hubei.gov.cn/zhuanti/2020/gzxxgzbd/qfqk/202002/t20200218_2111411.shtml) [snapshot](/images/hubeigov.png).  (Note: this narrative was debunked later by [one study](/20200507b.html).)

Also in January, doctors in “other country” also started using HCQ.  On January 29, a Chinese American youtuber Lude got a tip from a frequent guest saying: "国外公共医疗和内科医生朋友强推荐...让在家隔离的人快点购买服用，这个救命，硫酸羟氯喹". Translation: "Overseas public health and internal medicine doctors strongly recommend this, tell those who are self-quarantining at home, go buy and take Hydroxychloroquine, it will save your life".    [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3PQss3oMkg&t=1508s)  [snapshot](/images/lude.png).  (Note: It's hard to know which "the other country" is in this context, it might be South Korea or Singapore, or it was China after all as the host was based in US.)

China's official news agency Xinhua reported on January 30th, 2020 three drugs were effective on novel coronavirus at cellular level.  One of them is Chloroquine, the other two were Remdesivir and Ritonavir. [source (in Chinese)](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-01/30/c_138742163.htm) 

By the mid of February, there were 9 clinical trials about HCQ on Covid-19 in China. [source (in Chinese)](http://n.eastday.com/pnews/1581751164013488)

On February 19 2020, China released its 6th edition of "Novel Coronavirus Diagnosis and Treatment Guide".  The guide list Chloroquine (CQ) as one of the anti-viral drugs for Covid-19.  [Chinese PDF doc](/images/china-covid19-6th-edition.pdf)   Retrieved from [nhc.gov.cn](http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yzygj/s7653p/202002/8334a8326dd94d329df351d7da8aefc2.shtml)

###  March

On March 17th 2020, renowned French physician and microbiologist [Didier Raoult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Raoult) announced that he had successfully used HCQ and azithromycin (AZ) to treat Covid-19. 3 days later, his [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102549/) was published.  The study was criticized of having a small sample size (24).   (A few month later Raoult released [a study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893920302817) that shows HCQ and AZ lead to much better  outcome and faster viral load reduction than other treatments.  The sample size of that study is 3737.)

Then came the the famous tweet:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE &amp; AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine. The FDA has moved mountains - Thank You! Hopefully they will BOTH (H works better with A, International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents).....</p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1241367239900778501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

(Note "International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents" is the journal in which Raoult's first paper is published.) 

Late march, FDA issued an emergency order allowing doctors to use HCQ in Covid-19 patients.

Trump's critics questioned the solution he promoted.  Some claimed people in the president's inner circle stand to benefit from manufacturing HCQ.  However, HCQ costs less than $10 per treatment.  Compared with over $4000 for Remdesivir, such claim seemed too far fetched.

A few days later, Dr. Anthony Fauci [said on CNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIIgIKMgUIQ): there has been anecdotal non-proven data that it (CQ/HCQ) works... but when you have an uncontrolled trial you can never definitely say that it works.   By now we all know Dr. Fauci only believe in the "Gold Standard" - peer reviewed, randomized double blind placebo control (RDBPC) study.

In late March 2020, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko claimed his clinics treated Covid-19 patients with HCQ, none of patients needed hospitalization or a ventilator.  Shortly afterward Sean Hannity of Fox News  promoted Zelenko's method of treatment on his show.

### April

Dr. Zelenko [published](https://internetprotocol.co/hype-news/2020/04/07/how-to-cure-coronavirus-an-exclusive-letter-to-donald-trump/) his letter to President Trump.  In the letter, he suggested "the Zelenko protocal": HCQ 200mg twice a day; azithromycin 500mg once a day, zinc sulfate 220mg once a day, all for 5 days.  He stated [his rational](https://internetprotocol.co/hype-news/2020/04/14/a-detailed-coronavirus-treatment-plan-from-dr-zelenko/): "We know that hydroxychloroquine helps Zinc enter the cell. We know that Zinc slows viral replication within the cell. Regarding the use of azithromycin, I postulate it prevents secondary bacterial infections. These three drugs are well known and usually well-tolerated; hence the risk to the patient is low."

The result of the randomized study on CQ/HCQ conducted by Wuhan University Peoples' Hospital that started in February was [released](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758v3). It showed HCQ significantly shorten the Time to clinical recovery (TTCR), and in contrast with control group, no one in HCQ group progressed to severe case.  This study was ignored by the main street media (MSM).

What is not ignored is [a study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v2) that came out a few days later.  It found: no evidence that use of HCQ, either with or without azithromycin, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with Covid-19. An association of increased overall mortality was identified in patients treated with HCQ alone.  Didier Raoult later [pointed out](https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Response-to-Magagnoli.pdf) several problems of this study and said it does "not stand up to any methodological analysis".

### May

Many HCQ favorable studies came out in May.  They include [Dr. Raoult's study that involved 1061 cases](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32387409/),  [one from China](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32418114/), [another from China](https://academic.oup.com/nsr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nsr/nwaa113/5848167), [one from Spain](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202005.0057/v2), [one from US-NYU](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.02.20080036v1), [another from France](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.20114835v1), [also from France](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202005.0486/v1) (peer-reviewed and published later), and many more.

Studies that show HCQ is not effective also came along.  For examples: [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2766117), [this one](https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1844), [this one](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20099028v1), [this one](https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1849), and [this one](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.20109207v1). 

The cristicisim of these studies were also abound.  For example, [this study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2012410) was [accused of hiding HCQ benefits](https://twitter.com/dperetti/status/1259154552512798721)

Among all the studies, the most high-profile is the one from US, with its first author Prof. Mehra from Harvard.  Published on the Lancet, It's called ["Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19: a multinational registry analysis"](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31180-6/fulltext#%20).  Its finding: the use of a regimen containing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (with or without a macrolide) was associated with no evidence of benefit, but instead was associated with an increase in the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and a greater hazard for in-hospital death with COVID-19. These findings suggest that these drug regimens should not be used outside of clinical trials and urgent confirmation from randomized clinical trials is needed.

This is a bombshell.  Not only is HCQ useless, it can cause heart problem and kill you.

3 days after the publication, the World Health Organization (WHO) halted its clinical trials that use hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19, citing concerns from the Lancet study.  Other ongoing trials around the world were also stopped and paused.

It was soon noticed that the data in the Lancet study had serious problem: they were faked.

On May 27th 2020, Harvey Risch of Yale published [an technical analysis](https://academic.oup.com/aje/advance-article/doi/10.1093/aje/kwaa093/5847586) on then available studies, and concluded that HCQ+AZ+zinc works and safe, we should use them now 
until something better come along.  He urged: "It is our obligation not to stand by" as people are being killed by Covid-19.

### June

On June 4 2020, The Lancet apologized and retracted the study.  However, the damage done to HCQ could not be undone.  

Many HCQ favorable studies are published, many HCQ un-favorable studies were also published.  [Here is a list](/studies.html).  Go to [studies](/studies.html) for more.

[One study](https://covidpep.umn.edu/) that got the most attention is the randomized trail done by University of Minnesota.  [Its findings](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2016638) were published in New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM): "hydroxychloroquine did not prevent illness compatible with Covid-19 or confirmed infection when used as postexposure prophylaxis within 4 days after exposure".  In other word, it's useless.

The study was criticized because it used neither azithromycin nor zinc.  It's also criticized as not truly random by Dr. Harvey Risch.

On June 20 2020, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) halted its clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine, saying that while there are no ill side effects, it provides no benefit to COVID-19 patients.

### July

More studies came out in July.  But there are much more HCQ favorable studies than unfavorable ones. 

[Here is the list of studies](/studies.html) in July 2020.

A study welcomed by HCQ critics was [the one done at Oxford University](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20151852v1).  It met the gold standard because it was randomized controlled trial with a good sample size, and it said: *In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine was not associated with reductions in 28-day mortality but was associated with an increased length of hospital stay and increased risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death.*  MSM quoted this study to tell the public HCQ does't work and was even harmful.  The many problems with this study were never reported.  The biggest problem is its dosage.  It use 2000mg on the first day, then 800mg for the next 9 days.  The initial dosage is 4 time higher and total dosage is almost 8 times higher than the Zelenko protocal. No wonder patients had "increased risk".  If you drink too much water [you will also be poisoned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication)

[The most attacked study](https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)30534-8/fulltext) was [the one by Henry Ford Health System](https://www.henryford.com/news/2020/07/hydro-treatment-study) in Detroit Michigan.  The study shows *"treatment with hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with azithromycin was associated with reduction in COVID-19 associated mortality"*.  Among the critics, one stood out.  Dr. Fauci said it's "a flawed study" because it's  non-controlled and people who received hydroxychloroquine were also using corticosteroids.

Such information (or misinformation) is easy to find.  A good example is USA Today's so called ["Fact check"](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/07/21/fact-check-hydroxychloroquine-hasnt-helped-covid-19-studies-show/5407547002/).

On July 27 2020, a video posted on Facebook by "America's Frontline Doctors" went viral and become the top-performing post on the platform.  The video showed several doctors in white lab coats standing before the Supreme Court, one of them hailed HCQ a cure for Covid-19.

The video was soon taken down by both Facebook and Youtube.  Tweets promoting the video were censored, including those by Trump and his son.  [The group's founding doctor](https://twitter.com/drsimonegold) was [fired promptly](https://twitter.com/drsimonegold/status/1290079600454729728).  The doctor group's website americasfrontlinedoctors.com was shut down by its host Squarespace.  It did not help that [the doctor](https://twitter.com/stella_immanuel/) touting HCQ believed in [some crazy stuff](https://www.thedailybeast.com/stella-immanuel-trumps-new-covid-doctor-believes-in-alien-dna-demon-sperm-and-hydroxychloroquine).

### Augest

[The author](https://twitter.com/CovidAnalysis) of [c19study.com](https://c19study.com/) came up with a great idea that many countries either adopted or declined early treatment with HCQ, thus forming [a large country-randomized controlled trial](https://hcqtrial.com/).  The trial is of course ongoing, but the result so far shows countries using HCQ have 79.1% lower death per million than those not using.

At some point, you have to stop updating the timeline, and that is here.

[Here is my answer](/theanswer.html) to the question "Does HCQ Works?"

At this point, almost anyone who despice Trump also was against hydroxychloroquine. Those who love him also believe in HCQ.  No one read study papers.  No one listen to reasoning. People only seek information that re-enforce their confirmation bias, which further cement their biased belief.

## Summary

HCQ-induced macular toxicity is rare in routine clinical practice, seems to require prolonged HCQ therapy (>18â€‰years) and is not necessarily associated with functional visual loss. Our findings suggest that co-morbid conditions that are common in RA and SLE contribute substantially to vision loss and should not be ignored.

## Summary

```Hydroxychloroquine was associated with lower mortality when the model was adjusted for age and gender. The association between hydroxychloroquine and lower mortality observed in this study can be acknowledged by clinicians in hospitals and in the community. Randomized-controlled trials to assess the causal effects of hydroxychloroquine in different therapeutic regimes are required.

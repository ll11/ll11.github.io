    <h2>First of all, is it Safe?</h2>
    <p>Hydroxychloroquine has been used safely world-wide for over 50 years.  It's on <a href="https://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/en/">WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines</a>. 
        HCQ would not be on this list if it is unsafe.  It's as safe as paracetamol(acetaminophen, aka. Tylenol) and metformin, which are also on that list.  Valsartan, even though it's the most prescribed anti-hypertensive drug, is not on that list due to its side-effect.  HCQ is even allowed to be used during preganancy.
        The studies that claimed HCQ can cause heart problem either faked the data (and later retracted) or use dangareous high dosage. Almost all drugs have side-effects, if you take too much you will have problem.  For example, if you take too much <a href="https://www.dhmo.org/facts.html#CONCERN">dihydrogen monoxide</a>, you will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication">be poisoned</a>.
    </p>
    <p>It is known some people who take HCQ for more than 5 years and in high doses are at increased risk of retina damage known as retinopathy.  Covid-19 patients usually take HCQ for just a few days, so there's is no risk of retinopathy for them.
    </p>

    <p>In June 2020, <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-halts-clinical-trial-hydroxychloroquine">NIH halted HCQ clinical trial</a> citing reason: "while there was no harm, the study drug was very unlikely to be beneficial to hospitalized patients with COVID-19".  While it is unfortunate they stopped the trial for strange reason, at least they admit HCQ has <b>no harm</b>.
    </p>
    <p>Now we get safety out of the way, let's focus on if it works.
    </p>

    <h2>Is it effective?</h2>
    <p>Study after study show, if combined with azithromycin and/or zinc, HCQ is effective in treating early-stage Covid-19 patients.</p>
    <p>The comination is important. Azithromycin and especially zinc work together with HCQ to combat the virus.  <a href="https://covidpep.umn.edu/">The University of Minnesota trial</a> failed because it did not use azithromycin or zinc.  So did many other studies that claimed HCQ does not work. (What Minnesota study did not found is serious adverse effect, such as QT prolongation, even though it use a fairly high dose, which further prove HCQ is safe)
    </p>
    <p>The word <b>"early"</b> is equally important. There are significantly higher number of studies that show HCQ is effective than the ones that claim it's not.  In these positive studies, there is a strong evidence that outcomes are better when HCQ is used early in the disease's progression.
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://hcqtrial.com/">A large country-randomized controlled trial</a> with more than 2 billion (yes, the number is correct) people shows: HCQ treatment group has a 79% lower death rate than the control group.
    </p>
    <p>So, yes, it is effective.
    </p>

    <h2>Why does it work?</h2>
    <p>We don't know at this point.  One hypothesis is that HCQ is a zinc ionophore, which means HCQ help zinc get into cell, and zinc block the duplication of virus inside the cell.  Here's <a href="https://youtu.be/U7F1cnWup9M?t=93">an video on that theory</a>.
    </p>
    <p>(will update with more)
    </p>

    <h2>Why does everyone say it does not work?</h2>
    <p>When Trump promoted HCQ in March 2020, the natural response from anyone who doesn't like him is not believing him.  The effectiveness of HCQ became politicized right after that.  Most main street media, with the exception of Fox, are left-leaning now.  They tried their best to discredit HCQ and therefore Trump by not reporting HCQ favorable studies and amplifying negative ones.
    </p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxychloroquine">Wikipedia</a> says HCQ doesn't work.  Do you believe it? Just like MSM, it cites mostly sources of negative outcome.  (Fun fact: HCQ wiki page was edited a total 20 times in 2019, it was edited 800 times from March to Augest 2020)

    <p>Everyone has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>.  People only seek information that re-enforce their views, which further cement their often biased belief.  No one actually read study papers.  No one listen to reasoning. It's either us or them.
    </p>
    <p>But, if Trump says 1+1=2, are you going to insist that is not correct?
    </p>

    <h2>I have Covid-19, should I ask my Doctor for hydroxychloroquine?</h2>
    <p>Hope this site have already helped you answer this question.</p>
    <p>If you have maintained a disbelief in HCQ, I hope you put your political view aside and think rationally.  Please be like <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/08/08/nyc-councilman-credits-hydroxychloroquine-for-covid-19-recovery/">this guy.</a>
    </p>
    <p>But remember the combination with azithromycin and zinc, and the key is "early".
